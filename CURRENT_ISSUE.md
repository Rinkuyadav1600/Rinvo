# Current Issue - Backend Not Accessible from Live Site

## Problem Screenshot

![Error Screenshot](C:/Users/Admin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/35778bd8-9e3f-4096-bd4e-f91781d73ca0/uploaded_image_1767028565446.png)

## Error Details

**Error Message:** "Error: Conversion failed"
**Alert Message:** "Make sure backend server is running on port 3000"

## Root Cause

The backend server is running on `http://localhost:3000` which is only accessible from your local machine. When users access the live site at `https://portfolio-5aafe.web.app`, their browsers cannot connect to `localhost:3000`.

## Why This Happens

```
User's Browser (anywhere in the world)
    ↓
    Tries to connect to: http://localhost:3000
    ↓
    ❌ FAILS - localhost means "this computer"
    ↓
    Error: "Make sure backend server is running on port 3000"
```

## Current Architecture

```
✅ Frontend: https://portfolio-5aafe.web.app (Public, accessible)
❌ Backend: http://localhost:3000 (Private, only on your PC)
```

## Solution: Deploy Backend

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Free & Easy)

**Steps:**
1. Install Railway CLI
2. Deploy backend
3. Get public URL (e.g., `https://rinvo-backend.railway.app`)
4. Update all tool pages to use this URL instead of localhost
5. Redeploy frontend

### Option 2: Render (Free Tier)

**Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Render to GitHub
3. Deploy backend
4. Get public URL
5. Update frontend

### Option 3: Keep Client-Side Only

**Steps:**
1. Remove backend-dependent tools (PDF to Word, Word to PDF, etc.)
2. Keep only 6 client-side tools
3. Update index page to show only working tools

## Temporary Workaround

For local testing:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2: Run frontend locally
firebase serve
```

Then access: `http://localhost:5000`

Both will be on localhost, so it will work!

## Files That Need URL Update (After Backend Deployment)

1. `tools/pdf-to-word.html` - Line 125
2. `tools/word-to-pdf.html` - Line 125
3. `tools/pdf-to-excel.html` - Line 125
4. `tools/excel-to-pdf.html` - Line 125
5. `tools/pdf-to-powerpoint.html` - Line 125
6. `tools/powerpoint-to-pdf.html` - Line 125

Change:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/pdf-to-word', {
```

To:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/pdf-to-word', {
```

## Next Action Required

**Choose one:**
1. Deploy backend to Railway/Render (for full functionality)
2. Remove backend tools (for quick fix with 6 working tools)
3. Use local testing only (not for production)

Let me know which option you prefer!
